🚀 I’m passionate about working on the cutting edge of technology, developing AI solutions that tackle real-world challenges. With hands-on experience in NLP and Computer Vision, I thrive on building models, preprocessing data, and turning complex problems into actionable insights. Whether it’s crafting a sentiment analysis system or designing a hand-gesture mouse, I love the thrill of solving puzzles with code and data.

🎓 I’m pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Science and Culture, Tehran, with GPA of 3.6. My focus? Mastering AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
