I have recently started learning **Rust**, and it's been an exciting journey.  

### Why Rust?  
- Memory safety without a garbage collector  
- High performance  
- Great for system programming and web assembly  

I will be sharing tutorials, projects, and challenges I encounter while learning Rust. ðŸš€
